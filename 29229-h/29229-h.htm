<h2 class="gap3"><a name="WILLIAM_DUNLAP" id="WILLIAM_DUNLAP"></a>WILLIAM DUNLAP:</h2>

<h2>FATHER OF THE AMERICAN THEATRE</h2>

<h3>(1766-1839)</h3>


<p>The life of William Dunlap is full of colour and variety. Upon
his shoulders very largely rests the responsibility for whatever
knowledge we have of the atmosphere of the early theatre in
America, and of the personalities of the players. For, as a boy,
his father being a Loyalist, there is no doubt that young William
used to frequent the play-house of the Red Coats, and we would
like to believe actually saw some of the performances with which
Major Andr&eacute; was connected.</p>

<p>He was born at Perth Amboy, then the seat of government for
the Province of New Jersey, on February 19, 1766 (where he died
September 28, 1839), and, therefore, as an historian of the theatre,
he was able to glean his information from first hand sources.
Yet, his monumental work on the "History of the American
Theatre" was written in late years, when memory was beginning
to be overclouded, and, in recent times, it has been shown that
Dunlap was not always careful in his dates or in his statements.
George Seilhamer, whose three volumes, dealing with the
American Theatre before the year 1800, are invaluable, is particularly
acrimonious in his strictures against Dunlap. Nevertheless,
he has to confess his indebtedness to the Father of the
American Theatre.</p>

<p>Dunlap was many-sided in his tastes and activities. There is
small reason to doubt that from his earliest years the theatre
proved his most attractive pleasure. But, when he was scarcely
in the flush of youth, he went to Europe, and studied art under
Benjamin West. Throughout his life he was ever producing canvases,
and designing, and his interest in the art activity of the
country, which connects his name with the establishment of the
New York Academy of Design, together with his writing on the
subject, make him an important figure in that line of work.</p>

<p>On his return from Europe, as we have already noted, he was
fired to write plays through the success of Royall Tyler, and he
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_502" id="Page_502">[Pg 502]</a></span>began his long career as dramatist, which threw him upon his own
inventive resourcefulness, and so closely identified him with the
name of the German, Kotzebue, whose plays he used to translate
and adapt by the wholesale, as did also Charles Smith.</p>

<p>The pictures of William Dunlap are very careful to indicate in
realistic fashion the fact that he had but one eye. When a boy,
one of his playmates at school threw a stone, which hit his right
eye. But though he was thus early made single-visioned, he saw
more than his contemporaries; for he was a man who mingled
much in the social life of the time, and he had a variety of friends,
among them Charles Brockden Brown, the novelist, and George
Frederick Cooke, the tragedian. He was the biographer for both
of them, and these volumes are filled with anecdote, which throws
light, not only on the subjects, but upon the observational taste
of the writer. There are those who claim that he was unjust
to Cooke, making him more of a drunkard than he really was.
And the effect the book had on some of its readers may excellently
well be seen by Lord Byron's exclamation, after having
finished it. As quoted by Miss Crawford, in her "Romance of the
American Theatre," he said: "Such a book! I believe, since
'Drunken Barnaby's Journal,' nothing like it has drenched the
press. All green-room and tap-room, drams and the drama.
Brandy, whiskey-punch, and, latterly, toddy, overflow every
page. Two things are rather marvelous; first, that a man should
live so long drunk, and next that he should have found a sober
biographer."</p>

<p>Dunlap's first play was called "The Modest Soldier; or, Love
in New York" (1787). We shall let him be his own chronicler:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>As a medium of communication between the playwriter and
the manager, a man was pointed out, who had for a time been of
some consequence on the London boards, and now resided under
another name in New York. This was the Dubellamy of the English
stage, a first singer and <i>walking-gentleman</i>. He was now past his
meridian, but still a handsome man, and was found sufficiently easy
of access and full of the courtesy of the old school. A meeting was
arranged at the City Tavern, and a bottle of Madeira discussed with
the merits of this first-born of a would-be author. The wine was
praised, and the play was praised&mdash;the first, perhaps, made the second
tolerable&mdash;that must be good which can repay a man of the world for
listening to an author who reads his own play.</p></div>

<p>In due course of time, the youthful playwright reached the
presence of the then all-powerful actors, Hallam and Henry, and,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_503" id="Page_503">[Pg 503]</a></span>
after some conference with them, the play was accepted. But
though accepted, it was not produced, that auspicious occasion
being deferred whenever the subject was broached. At this time,
young Dunlap was introduced to the stony paths of playwriting.
He had to alter his manuscript in many ways, only to see it laid
upon the shelf until some future occasion. And, according to his
confession, the reason the piece did not receive immediate production
was because there was no part which Henry, the six-foot,
handsome idol of the day, could see himself in to his own
satisfaction.</p>

<p>Dunlap's next play was "The Father; or, American Shandy-ism,"<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
which was produced on September 7, 1789. It was published
almost immediately, and was later reprinted, under the
title of "The Father of an Only Child."</p>

<p>Most historians call attention to the fact that to Dunlap belongs
the credit of having first introduced to the American stage
the German dialect of the later Comedian. Even as we look to
Tyler's "The Contrast" for the first Yankee, to Samuel Low's
"Politician Out-witted" for an early example of Negro dialect, so
may we trace other veins of American characteristics as they
appeared in early American dramas.</p>

<p>But it is to "Darby's Return,"<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> the musical piece, that our interest
points, because it was produced for the benefit of Thomas
Wignell, at the New-York Theatre (November 24, 1789), and
probably boasted among its first-nighters George Washington.
Writes Dunlap:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The eyes of the audience were frequently bent on his countenance,
and to watch the emotions produced by any particular passage upon
him was the simultaneous employment of all. When Wignell, as
<i>Darby</i>, recounts what had befallen him in America, in New York, at
the adoption of the Federal Constitution, and the inauguration of the
President, the interest expressed by the audience in the looks and the
changes of countenance of this great man became intense.</p></div>

<p>And then there follows an indication by Dunlap of where
Washington smiled, and where he showed displeasure. And,
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_504" id="Page_504">[Pg 504]</a></span>altogether, there was much perturbation of mind over every
quiver of his eye-lash. The fact of the matter is, as a playgoer, the
Father of our Country figured quite as constantly as the Father
of our Theatre. When the seat of Government changed from New
York to Philadelphia, President Washington's love of the theatre
prompted many theatrical enterprises to follow in his wake, and
we have an interesting picture, painted in words by Seilhamer
(ii, 316), of the scene at the old Southwark on such an occasion.
He says:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>[The President] frequently occupied the east stage-box, which was
fitted up expressly for his reception. Over the front of the box was
the United States coat-of-arms and the interior was gracefully
festooned with red drapery. The front of the box and the seats were
cushioned. According to John [<i>sic</i>] Durang, Washington's reception
at the theatre was always exceedingly formal and ceremonious. A
soldier was generally posted at each stage-door; four soldiers were
placed in the gallery; a military guard attended. Mr. Wignell, in a
full dress of black, with his hair elaborately powdered in the fashion
of the time, and holding two wax candles in silver candle-sticks, was
accustomed to receive the President at the box-door and conduct
Washington and his party to their seats. Even the newspapers
began to take notice of the President's contemplated visits to the
theatre.</p></div>

<p>This is the atmosphere which must have attended the performance
of Dunlap's "Darby's Return."</p>

<p>The play which probably is best known to-day, as by William
Dunlap, is his "Andr&eacute;,"<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> in which Washington figures as the
General, later to appear under his full name, when Dunlap utilized
the old drama in a manuscript libretto, entitled "The Glory
of Columbia&mdash;Her Yeomanry" (1817). The play was produced on
March 30, 1798, after Dunlap had become manager of the New
Park Theatre, within whose proscenium it was given. Professor
Matthews, editing the piece for the Dunlap Society (No. 4, 1887),
claims that this was the first drama acted in the United States
during Washington's life, in which he was made to appear on
the stage of a theatre. But it must not be forgotten that in
"The Fall of British Tyranny," written in 1776, by Leacock,
Washington appears for the first time in any piece of American
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_505" id="Page_505">[Pg 505]</a></span>fiction. Dunlap writes of the performance (American Theatre,
ii, 20):</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>The receipts were 817 dollars, a temporary relief. The play was
received with warm applause, until Mr. Cooper, in the character
of a young American officer, who had been treated as a brother
by Andr&eacute; when a prisoner with the British, in his zeal and gratitude,
having pleaded for the life of the spy in vain, tears the American
cockade from his casque, and throws it from him. This was not, perhaps
could not be, understood by a mixed assembly; they thought
the country and its defenders insulted, and a hiss ensued&mdash;it was soon
quieted, and the play ended with applause. But the feeling excited
by the incident was propagated out of doors. Cooper's friends wished
the play withdrawn, on his account, fearing for his popularity. However,
the author made an alteration in the incident, and subsequently
all went on to the end with applause.</p></div>

<p>A scene from the last act of "Andr&eacute;"<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> was produced at an
American Drama Matin&eacute;e, under the auspices of the American
Drama Committee of the Drama League of America, New York
Centre, on January 22nd and 23rd, 1917. There are many
Arnold and Andr&eacute; plays, some of which have been noted by Professor
Matthews.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> Another interesting historical study is the
stage popularity of Nathan Hale.</p>

<p>We might go on indefinitely, narrating incidents connected
with Dunlap as citizen, painter, playwright, author, and theatrical
manager, for within a very short time he managed the John
Street and New Park Theatres, retiring for a while in 1805.</p>

<p>But this is sufficient to illustrate the pioneer character of
his work and influence. Inaccurate he may have been in his
"History of the American Theatre," but the atmosphere is there,
and he never failed to recognize merit, and to give touches of
character to the actors, without which our impression of the early
theatre in this country would be the poorer. The name of William
Dunlap is intimately associated with the beginnings of
American painting, American literary life and the American
Theatre. It is for these he will ever remain distinguished.</p>

<p>As a playwright, he wrote so rapidly, and so constantly utilized
over and over again, not only his own material, but the materials
of others, that it is not surprising to find him often in dispute with
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_506" id="Page_506">[Pg 506]</a></span>dramatic authors of the time. A typical disagreement occurred
in the case of the actor John Hodgkinson (1767-1805), whose
drama, "The Man of Fortitude; or, the Knight's Adventure,"
given at the John Street Theatre, on June 7, 1797, was, according
to Dunlap, based on his own one-act verse play, "The Knight's
Adventure," submitted to the actor some years before.</p>

<p>Only the play, based on the 1798 edition, is here reproduced.
The authentic documents are omitted.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_507" id="Page_507">[Pg 507]</a></span></p>

<h2 class="gap3"><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>


<p>More than nine years ago the Author made choice of the
death of Major Andr&eacute; as the Subject of a Tragedy, and part
of what is now offered to the public was written at that time.
Many circumstances discouraged him from finishing his Play,
and among them must be reckoned a prevailing opinion that
recent events are unfit subjects for tragedy. These discouragements
have at length all given way to his desire of bringing a
story on the Stage so eminently fitted, in his opinion, to excite
interest in the breasts of an American audience.</p>

<p>In exhibiting a stage representation of a real transaction, the
particulars of which are fresh in the minds of many of the audience,
an author has this peculiar difficulty to struggle with, that
those who know the events expect to see them <i>all</i> recorded; and
any deviation from what they remember to be fact, appears to
them as a fault in the poet; they are disappointed, their expectations
are not fulfilled, and the writer is more or less condemned,
not considering the difference between the poet and the historian,
or not knowing that what is intended to be exhibited is a free
poetical picture, not an exact historical portrait.</p>

<p>Still further difficulties has the Tragedy of Andr&eacute; to surmount,
difficulties independent of its own demerits, in its way to public
favour. The subject necessarily involves political questions; but
the Author presumes that he owes no apology to any one for
having shewn himself an American. The friends of Major
Andr&eacute; (and it appears that all who knew him were his friends)
will look with a jealous eye on the Poem, whose principal incident
is the sad catastrophe which his misconduct, in submitting to
be an instrument in a transaction of treachery and deceit, justly
brought upon him: but these friends have no cause of offence;
the Author has adorned the poetical character of Andr&eacute; with
every virtue; he has made him his Hero; to do which, he was
under the necessity of making him condemn his own conduct, in
the one dreadfully unfortunate action of his life. To shew the
effects which Major Andr&eacute;'s excellent qualities had upon the
minds of men, the Author has drawn a generous and amiable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_509" id="Page_509">[Pg 509]</a></span>
youth, so blinded by his love for the accomplished Briton, as to
consider his country, and the great commander of her armies, as
in the commission of such horrid injustice, that he, in the anguish
of his soul, disclaims the service. In this it appears, since the first
representation, that the Author has gone near to offend the veterans
of the American army who were present on the first night,
and who not knowing the sequel of the action, felt much disposed
to condemn him: but surely they must remember the diversity
of opinion which agitated the minds of men at that time, on the
question of the propriety of putting Andr&eacute; to death; and when
they add the circumstances of Andr&eacute;'s having saved the life of
this youth, and gained his ardent friendship, they will be inclined
to mingle with their disapprobation, a sentiment of pity, and
excuse, perhaps commend the Poet, who has represented the
action without sanctioning it by his approbation.</p>

<p>As a sequel to the affair of the cockade, the Author has added
the following lines, which the reader is requested to insert, page
<a href="#FNanchor_8_8">55</a>, between the 5th and 15th lines, instead of the lines he will find
there, which were printed before the piece was represented.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a>&mdash;</p>

<p>This alteration, as well as the whole performance, on the second
night, met the warm approbation of the audience.</p>

<p>To the performers the Author takes this opportunity of returning
his thanks for their exertions in his behalf; perfectly convinced,
that on this, as on former occasions, the members of the
Old American Company have anxiously striven to oblige him.</p>

<p>If this Play is successful, it will be a proof that recent events
may be so managed in tragedy as to command popular attention;
if it is unsuccessful, the question must remain undetermined until
some more powerful writer shall again make the experiment. The
Poem is now submitted to the ordeal of closet examination, with
the Author's respectful assurance to every reader, that as it is
not his interest, so it has not been his intention, to offend any;
but, on the contrary, to impress, through the medium of a pleasing
stage exhibition, the sublime lessons of Truth and Justice
upon the minds of his countrymen.</p>
